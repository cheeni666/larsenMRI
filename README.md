## Multivariate Larsen to process MRI images
The goal of this project is to implement a multivariate regressive model using the larsen algorithm to process MRI images.
This project is based on the below paper.
Inferring Brain Dyamics Using Granger Causality On FMRI Data by Guillermo A. Cecchi, Rahul Garg and A. Ravishankar Rao.

## Brief model of the Cuda Implementation
Based on the CPU implementation of the FARM code and larsen code from the github repo: https://github.com/DushyantSahoo/granger
We maintatin a buffer which stores all the current executing modelâ€˜s index. Each element in the buffer can be visualized as a worker which executes the larsen code for that respective model independently of other workers. 
After the worker completes the larsen algorithm for that respective model it removes the model saves it and adds a new incomplete model to this index and continues executing independently. 
## The model
The buffer size is determined by calculating remaining memory in the gpu and setting the buffer size such that 90% of the remaining memory is filled. Brief model flow is shown below:
N is the buffer size.

## Inside the worker
Inside each worker the standard larsen code from the earlier mentioned repo gets executed. Some of the important codes executing are:
Finding correlation and residuals.
Finding the gram matrix and its inverse parallely.
The gram inversion is done using the parallelized Gauss Jordan Matrix Inversion algorithm.
Moving towards OLS solution.
Adding and removing lasso variables.
Updating beta, residuals, etc.
For further information about the kernels the comments in the code explain more clearly.
## The code
The *.cu file is the main file and uses FileProc.h and larsProc.h.
FileProc.h cotains list of file processing functions and uses FileProcKernel.h.
LarsProc.h is the core larsen file and uses LarsProcKernel.h.
The *Kernel.h files are files containing the cuda kernels.
## Using the code
Cuda Toolkit >= 6 necessary.
Nvcc *.cu to generate the executable file.
./a.out <path:2dFlattenedMRIimageUsingOctave>
Example:
nvcc MultivariateLarsen.cu.
./a.out data/number.txt.
where number.txt is the flattened 2dMRIimage generated by octave only.
The code generates three csv files:QBeta.csv(sparse 2d matrix) containing the beta values, QStep.csv(sparse 1d array) containing larsen step, QRess.csv(sparse 1d array) containing the larsen residues.
## If not using octave to flatten MRI image
Then the 2d Flattened MRI image must be in this format shown below:
These 5 lines must be added to the 2dimage.txt file followed by the 2dimage itself where values in each row are separated by spaces and rows are separated by newlines.
Example:
#### # Non important line
#### # Non important line
#### # Non important line
#### # rows: 2
#### # columns: 2
#### 1 2
#### 3 4
